## About

Sri Lanka is one of the best places to volunteer in the world. In fact Sri Lanka has the highest rate of volunteering in the world according to the <a href="https://www.unv.org/Our-stories/Facilitating-dialogue-volunteerism-and-inclusion-Sri-Lanka">UN Volunteers</a>.

> Sri Lanka has the highest rate of volunteering in the world. Each year
> an average of around seven million people volunteered their time,
> nearly half of those aged over 15 in the country.
> ---CAF World Giving Index


But finding a project to volunteer is not so easy. Mainly because different hosts publish their projects on their own websites and facebook pages and they are scattered everywhere. VolunteerME is a common place to list down all the volunteering opportunities in Sri Lanka so that anyone can easily find and work in projects.
